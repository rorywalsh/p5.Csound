## p5.Csound

p5.Csound is a lightweight wrapper to the web assembly build of Csound. It provides all the power of Csound inside p5.js sketches. With over a thousand processing opcodes, it is one of the most extensive audio processing libraries available in a browser. This interface provides very little in the way of wrapper functions. In fact, it only provides two; one for creating an instance of Csound, and the other for loading assets. After that, everything is accessible through the core Csound object. 

Note this project would not be possible without direct contributions of <font color="cornflowerblue">Steven Yi</font>, <font color="cornflowerblue">Hlöðver Sigurðsson</font>, <font color="cornflowerblue">Joachim Heintz</font>. 

If you have no previous experience with Csound and p5.js it might be worth taking a look at the Csound FLOSS manual, which provides interactive learning examples via the browser. The floss manual can be found [here](https://flossmanual.csound.com/). You can also check out the [p5.js](https://https://p5js.org/) website which has lots of great learning resources. Finally, the documentation for the WASM build of Csound can be found [here](https://github.com/csound/csound/tree/master/wasm/browser).
