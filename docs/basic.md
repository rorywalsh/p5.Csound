## Basic overview

The p5.csound.js library file bundles both the p5.Csound wrapper, and the WASM build of Csound into a single JS file. If you wish to build the library yourself, see the building page. Otherwise just use the prebuilt version in the releases page. Once you have the library, you need only include that file in your sketche's index.html:

```
<body>
  <main>
  </main>
  <script src="path/to/p5.csound.js"></script>
  <script src="sketch.js"></script>
</body>
```

With that done, you can create an instance of Csound using the `Csound.create()` method. Almost all of Csound's library functions are marked as `async`. This mean you will need to mark some p5.js functions as `async` too. For example, if we load Csound in the `p5.preload()` function, we need to mark it as `async`.

```js
async function preload() {
  csound = await Csound.create({options:['-odac', '--0dbfs=1']});
}
```

The `Csound.create()` function returns a Csound object. It can be passed an optional object, with the following optional arguments:

* `inputChannelCount` : sets the number of input channels, defaults to `2`
* `outputChannelCount` : sets the number of output channels, defaults to `2`
* `spn` : set to `true` to explicitly request ScriptProcessorNode rather than AudioWorklet, defaults to `false`
* `worker`: set to `true` to use backend using Web Workers to run Csound in a thread separate from audio callback, defaults to `false`
* `options`: an array of Csound options, similar to those you would see in the `<CsOptions></CsOptions>` of a typical Csound .csd file

> Note that `0dbfs` is set to 1 by default, but can be overridden with the `--0dbfs=N` option. 

Only one Csound object can be created per script. Once you have created the core `csound` object, you can compile some Csound code using the `csound.evalCode()` function. Although you can compile entire Csound files and score segments too, the examples presented here all use `csound.evalCode()` to compile and run Csound code. For example, the following code will compile instrument 1. 

```js
    await csound.evalCode(`
    instr 1
    kEnv madsr .1, .2, .8, .4
    a1 oscili kEnv, random(100, 1000)
    outs a1, a1
    endin
    `);
```

With some code compiled you can call `Csound.startAudio()` to start a Csound performance. A full preload function might look like this.

```js
async function preload() {
    csound = await Csound.create({options:['-odac', '--0dbfs=1']});

    await csound.evalCode(`
    instr 1
    kEnv madsr .1, .2, .8, .4
    a1 oscili kEnv, random(100, 1000)
    outs a1, a1
    endin
    `);

    await Csound.startAudio();
}
```

<blockquote style="font-size:14px;color:#ddd;background-color:#374752">
When <code>Csound.startAudio()</code> is called, Csound will create a new audio context. If the browser doesn't detect a user event within a few moment of the context being created, it might suspend the audio context due to strict autoplay policies. If this happens, Csound will either need to be started again. To do this one can call the <code>Csound.resumeAudio()</code> function which checks the context, and if it is suspended will restart Csound.  
</blockquote>

The `csound.evalCode()` function can also be used to trigger instances of an instrument by calling the `schedule` opcode. For example, we can trigger the above instrument to play from a `mousePressed()` function.

```js
async function mousePressed(){
    startTime = 0
    instrument = 1
    duration = 5
    await csound.evalCode(`schedule(${instrument}, ${startTime}, ${duration})`);
}
```

Please look through the various examples for further details on running, and controlling Csound instruments from a p5.js sketch.
